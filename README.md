# OOD-Blueprints: Practical Object-Oriented Design in Java

## Overview

This project showcases **Object-Oriented Design (OOD)** principles through practical Java implementations. It is structured into multiple problems, each modeling real-world entities using encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and design patterns.

## Features

- **Modular Codebase**: Divided into distinct packages (`problem1`, `problem2`, `problem3`), each tackling a unique OOD challenge.
- **Encapsulation & Abstraction**: Secure handling of user credentials and financial data.
- **Separation of Concerns**: Each entity has a clear, single responsibility.
- **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**: Includes JUnit test cases for validation.

## Technologies Used

- **Java 17+**
- **Gradle** for build automation
- **JUnit** for unit testing

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/OOD-Blueprints.git
   cd OOD-Blueprints
   ```

2. Build the project:

   ```sh
   ./gradlew build
   ```

3. Run tests:

   ```sh
   ./gradlew test
   ```

## Why This Project?

This repository demonstrates **strong OOD principles**, making it an excellent showcase for software design skills. It highlights:
